    <!-- Define an arrow function greetLater that takes a parameter name and logs "Hello, [name]" 
    after 2 seconds. Use setTimeout to delay the log. The arrow function should use the global
    this context.Explain why the this context behaves the way it does in an arrow function. -->
    <script>
        let name = 'ALice';
        window.name = name; // Set window.name to 'ALice'
        
        const greetLater = () => {
            setTimeout(function() {
                console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
            }.bind(this), 2000); // Bind 'this' to the global object (window)
        };
    
        greetLater();
    </script>
    <!-- If you specifically want to work with the global this (like window in browsers), 
    you can use bind to bind the correct this manually: -->
    <!-- Binding this manually: The .bind(this) ensures that the this inside the arrow function refers
    to the global object (or window in a browser).In this case, the this.name will refer to 
    window.name. You can manually set window.name if you want to align it with the global name
    variable:
     -->
<!-- 
     Arrow functions don't have their own this, so they rely on the lexical scope. To use this in your scenario, a regular function inside setTimeout will bind this dynamically.
     Alternatively, you can manually bind this to the global context (like window).
     In a browser, this in the global scope refers to window, but the global name variable is not the same as window.name. You can explicitly set window.name to achieve the desired result. -->

     <!-- bind() is a method in JavaScript. It is a function that belongs to Function objects and 
     is used to explicitly set the this context for any function.

How bind() Works:
Purpose: bind() creates a new function where the this value is explicitly set to whatever you pass 
to bind(). This is useful when you want to control the this context in different situations,
especially when using callbacks.
