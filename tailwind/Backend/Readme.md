Step 1: Install Node.js and npm Before starting, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed

2.Initialize a new Node.js project: This will create a package.json file that holds metadata about the project and its dependencies. npm init This command prompts you to provide some details like name, version, and entry point. You can either provide values or press Enter to accept defaults.

Step 3: Install Dependencies For a backend project, youâ€™ll typically need a web framework like Express.

Install Express: npm install express This command installs Express and adds it to the dependencies section of the package.json file.

Step 4: Create the Entry Point (index.js) Create a new file index.js inside the project directory. This will be the entry point of your backend server.

5.In the package.json file, add a start script if you want to add ES modules, add "type": "module" to your package.json

6.run the server using the start script defined in package.json: npm start
